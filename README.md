# Bark!
Bark! is a DNS resolver written in Rust. "Why would anyone code a DNS resolver from scratch?", you
might be asking yourself. The answer is: just because. Seriously, this project is for learning purposes,
because I already know Rust but I wanted to use it a bit more extensively in a medium
project. So, this project currently is a (VERY) small resolver, but my intention
is to create a (VERY) small DNS server.

This project is based on these resources:
- [RFC 1034](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1034)
- [RFC 1035](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1035)
- [DNS golang package](https://github.com/miekg/dns)
- [CoreDNS](https://github.com/coredns/coredns)
